# The Effect of LLM Assistance on Diagnostic Accuracy: A Meta-Analysis

**Importance:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to assist physicians. Still, their effect on the diagnostic accuracy of physicians remains unclear.

**Objective:** This study assesses the effect of LLM assistance on the diagnostic accuracy of physicians.

**Data Sources:** We conducted a systematic literature review with a search of MEDLINE and medRxiv databases between January 2020 and June 2025 to identify articles on LLM assistance of physicians for diagnosis.

**Study Selection:** Included studies needed to analyze the effect of LLM assistance on diagnostic accuracy of physicians. The PROBAST checklist was used to assess the risk of bias.

**Data Extraction and Synthesis:** This meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA reporting guideline. We applied a random-effects model using restricted maximum-likelihood estimation. A three-level meta-analytic model was used to account for dependent effect sizes, and cluster-robust variance estimation with small-sample corrections was applied.

**Main Outcomes and Measures:** The primary outcome was the pooled change in diagnostic accuracy resulting from LLM assistance compared to physicians without assistance.

**Results:** Our search identified 15 studies (43 effect sizes, N = 498 physicians). Most studies assessed the assistance of GPT-4 (7/15 studies) and focused on radiology (7/15 studies) or general medicine (6/15 studies). The pooled analysis showed that LLM assistance improved diagnostic accuracy (Hedges’ g = 0.202, 95% CI [0.116, 0.288]; P < .001). Meta-regressions indicated significant positive effects across LLM models (GPT-4 g = 0.19, AMIE g = 0.27, MedFound-DX-PA g = 0.15), medical fields (general medicine g = 0.32, radiology g = 0.10), career stages of physicians (attendings g = 0.20, residents g = 0.15), and for reasoning-based response formats (e.g., chain-of-thought explanations g = 0.15).

**Conclusions and Relevance:** Our results show that LLM assistance can improve diagnostic accuracy of physicians. However, we also find that several subgroups, such as different LLM models, medical fields, career stages, or LLM response formats affect diagnostic accuracy so that conditions for successful LLM assistance remain unclear. Further clinical evidence is needed to guide safe and effective integration into practice.
